    <p> Tom met his Ellie in 2009 and they were engaged in 2011. Sadly, Ellie died of breast cancer in May 2012. You
        can
        read her story at <a href="http://www.writtenoff.net" target="_blank">www.writtenoff.net</a>
    </p>

    <p>In 2012 Tom and some of Ellie’s Friends established a charity called The Eleanor Rose Foundation with the aim
        of improving the lives of people living with cancer. 2le are proud to support the charity’s main initiative,
        Ellie’s Friends, and you can find out more about the work we do at&nbsp;<a
