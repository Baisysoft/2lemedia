    <p><strong>The Work Experience</strong> is a comedy series that mixes the sitcom, mock doc and prank show
        formats to create an original and hilarious offering for E4. Set in the madness of new fashion PR agency
        Grade PR, each week the show follows two ambitious interns as they embark on a week of tasks, tantrums
        and tears. However, unknown to them, the entire agency is fictional and the employees are a cleverly
        cast mix of talented actors. Whether it be fetching a celebrity’s sperm sample or exposing an illegal
        sweatshop, the work experience staff are central to every hissy fit and bizarre request.</p>

    <p><strong>Asylum</strong> is a new, single camera comedy for BBC4, conceived by Kayvan Novak (<i>Facejacker,
        Cuban Fury, Four Lions, Inside Number 9</i>) and producer Tom Thostrup.</p>

    <p>Inspired by various whistleblowers and internet entrepreneurs, our two protagonists (Dan and Ludo) are
        under the threat of extradition, trapped in the London embassy of a fictional central American country.
        Dan Hern (Ben Miller) is a serious, self-important egotist who leaked classified government documents,
        whilst Ludo Backslash (Dustin Demri-Burns) is a loveable, childish internet pirate who set up a file
        sharing website and became public enemy number one amongst the entertainment community. They are very
        much the classic odd couple.</p>

    <p>Asylum is written by two new writers Peter Bowden and Thom Phipps, and produced by Tom Thostrup at 2LE
        Media. Roger Drew (<i>Veep, The Thick Of It</i>) is script editor.</p>
